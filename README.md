# ATC_R_Project
CIS_663_R project first initial Repository !

Abstract
Idea of this project was to analyze and predict the delay of flights exceeding 15 minutes or more using previous flight data with variables like carrier, Airport, weather, etc., using R packages, which will help to predict the flight delays which can be valuable to both airlines and passengers in managing their travel. After the Idea of building the predictive model, foremost step in the process is finding the research gaps and understanding the research done by the previous researchers will provide a brief Idea in the aspects like starting point and methods to follow to build such predictive model. This project begins with finding the suitable data to build the predictive model. After finding the data pre-processing and cleaning the data for analysis will be the first step by understanding the descriptives of the data in R. This process includes identifying the suitable packages in the R to present and analyze Data. After Identifying the suitable packages for analysis, building Regression model for the cleaned data will the following step. The last step of this project will be creating a interactive dash board using shiny package in the R.
