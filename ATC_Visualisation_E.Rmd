This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Loading_Data, echo=TRUE}
#Loading and Inspecting the DATA
install.packages("readr")
library(readr)
Flight_DATA <- read.csv("G:/My Drive/CIS 663 R programming/ATC_R_Project/DATA/air_traffic_main_Data.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r  Viewing_Data, echo = FALSE}
head(Flight_DATA)
tail(Flight_DATA)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
